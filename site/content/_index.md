  heading: Welcome 1
  text: >-
    We are a welcoming community striving together to know Christ and to make
    him known. We come from many different backgrounds politically and
    spiritually but we are all committed to living out of the liturgical and
    sacramental tradition which we have inherited.


    We are a parish member of the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon, a constituent member of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and of the Anglican Communion.


    Where will you find us when you come to Seaside? We are located five blocks north of Broadway (the road that leads to the turnaround on the Prom), one block west of Highway Church Altar101(one block towards the beach). We're on the corner of North Holladay and Sixth.


    When we gather in worship, we usually celebrate the Holy Eucharist. We also get together for social and community functions. We are active with some of the other mainline churches in the area such as our ecumenical Bible Study and outreach.


    We encourage visitors to the area to worship with us and residents to

    consider joining our fellowship.


    Don’t dress up; dress comfortably. We are at the beach, after all!
